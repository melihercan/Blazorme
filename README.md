# Blazorme.Diff

Diff component library for Blazor apps. 

## Introduction
The idea is to render diff of the two input strings in different output display formats. Output is always in HTML and currently 3 output display formats are provided:
* Inline: This will diplay the diff on the same line. This diff is intented for HTML inputs although plain text can also be provided.
* Row: This is line by line format for text inputs.
* Column: This is side by side format for text inputs.
