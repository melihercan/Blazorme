# Blazorme
This project provides utility component libraries for Blazor apps. 
Currently two component libraries have been implemented:
* [Blazorme.Diff:](Diff/README.md) It will render diff of the two input strings in different output display formats.
It can also be used as a library to get diff or html diff output strings from code behind. ![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Blazorme.Diff.svg)
* [Blazorme.Split:](Split/README.md) It provides resizeable split views (panes). ![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Blazorme.Split.svg)

You can run the [Demo](https://melihercan.github.io/) here.
