# Blazorme
This project provides utility component libraries for Blazor apps. 
Currently three component libraries have been implemented:
* [Blazorme.Diff:](Diff/README.md) It will render diff of the two input strings in different output display formats.
It can also be used as a library to get diff or html diff output strings from code behind. [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Blazorme.Diff.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazorme.Diff)
* [Blazorme.Split:](Split/README.md) It provides resizeable split views (panes). [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Blazorme.Split.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazorme.Split)
* [Blazorme.TestHost:](TestHost/README.md) Library for Blazor components unit testing. [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Blazorme.TestHost.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazorme.TestHost)
* [Blazorme.StreamSaver:](StreamSaver/README.md) (WASM only) Download files by writing incoming data chunks directly to the file instead of accumulating them in memory. That will prevent memory overflows for very large files. [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Blazorme.StreamSaver.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazorme.StreamSaver)
