# Blazorme
This project provides utility component libraries for Blazor apps. 
Currently three component libraries have been implemented:
* [Blazorme.Diff:](Diff/README.md) It will render diff of the two input strings in different output display formats.
It can also be used as a library to get diff or html diff output strings from code behind. [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Blazorme.Diff.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Blazorme.Diff)
