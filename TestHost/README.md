# Blazorme.TestHost
Blazor component testing helpers library. The source code is taken from Steve Sanderson's [BlazorUnitTestingPrototype](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/BlazorUnitTestingPrototype) project. See his [blog post](https://blog.stevensanderson.com/2019/08/29/blazor-unit-testing-prototype/
) for more details. This project is available only as source code. I believe getting this library as NuGet package is much more convenient. Therefore I integrated his code into a NuGet package with updated packages.
